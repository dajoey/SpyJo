// continues that attempt instead of starting a new one, then deletes the mark.
// `attempt` drives the roster escalation ladder and the fleet attempt cap, so
// a park that spends it promotes work up the model ladder for nothing
// (2026-09-24: 30 of 40 ops tasks with attempt>1 climbed through a park or a
// restart, five through a genuine model failure).
//
// Provenance: Spynel writes the mark itself while reconciling the transition
// a turn made, and removes it from every other transition it reconciles, so a
// turn cannot credit its own requeue. A park made outside a turn (the attempt
// cap parks a task straight out of todo/ after its attempt already ended) is
// never marked. Resume paths — Spynel's scheduled wake and external scripts
// moving waiting/ back to todo/ — only have to keep the field; every claim
// removes it, so it is honoured at most once.
