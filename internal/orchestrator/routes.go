// external runner watchdog fails such a task forward after 10 minutes of stale
// heartbeat, which costs the task an attempt it never got a fair run at. Recover
// it in minutes instead, and bound the quick path -- a lease whose recovery turns
// have ended empty this many times is a broken runner rather than an interrupted
