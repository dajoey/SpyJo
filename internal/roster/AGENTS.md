# Roster DOX

## Purpose

- Own the optional workspace staffing file `.spynel/roster.yaml` and its private per-day usage count.

## Local Contracts

- A missing roster means legacy routing; an invalid roster returns an error the caller logs before using legacy routing. Roster problems never fail a dispatch.
- Staff names and runner kinds are validated identifiers; launch arguments are single-line strings passed to the process without shell expansion.
- A daily cap requires a fallback. A session key keeps the staff it was first given that day, so retries and recoveries count once. The last fallback link is used even when capped, so work always has a runner.
- `escalation` is one mapping or a list of rungs; an implementation attempt goes to the rung with the highest `after_attempt` below it. A task's own valid `staff:` pin outranks every rung except the top one.
- `notify_at` never changes routing: reaching it writes one parked task per staff per day into `tasks/waiting/` with a `joey_ask` choice (continue / stop). The workspace pump asks Joey; the resumed task records his answer in `runtime/roster-decisions.json`. `continue` lifts `daily_cap` for that staff that day, `stop` halts it at once, no answer leaves `daily_cap` as the halt. `notify_at` must be below `daily_cap`.
- Workflow document phases are routed by the orchestrator; `chat`, `notification`, and `heartbeat` roles are routed by the Herdr harness from the session key, only when the turn carries the configured default model (an explicit per-conversation model wins).
- `routing` is the optional machine-readable domain table task filers stamp `staff:` from. Each entry names one `domain`; empty `staff` means filers omit the pin (role default), a `held_until` marks a HELD domain whose named `staff` is the temporary fallback. Domains are unique and single-line, staff names must exist, and a held domain must name its fallback. The authoritative human table lives in the workspace chat-agent instructions; this block is its validated machine copy, and a missing block stays legacy-compatible.
- The usage count under `runtime/` is bookkeeping only and never workflow authority.
